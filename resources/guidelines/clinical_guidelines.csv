Gene	Activity	Guideline
DPYD	2	<b>The genotyping indicates that there is no reason to fear impaired breakdown of fluoropyrimidine.</b><br> Treatment with capecitabine or fluorouracil should therefore be based on the patient's other conditions. Concentration determination may still be considered during fluorouracil treatment due to considerable variation in exposure level between different patients.
DPYD	1.5	<b>The genotyping indicates a slightly reduced ability to break down fluoropyrimidines.</b><br> When treating with capecitabine or fluorouracil, it is therefore recommended that the starting dose be lowered to 50-75% of the usual starting dose. Concentration determination should be considered during fluorouracil treatment due to considerable variation in exposure level between different patients.
DPYD	1	<b>The genotyping indicates a reduced ability to break down fluoropyrimidines.</b><br> When treating with capecitabine or fluorouracil, a halving of the starting dose should be considered. Concentration determination is recommended as follow-up in fluorouracil treatment.
DPYD	0.5	<b>The genotyping has shown a greatly reduced ability to break down fluoropyrimidines.</b><br> Therefore, avoid treatment with capecitabine and fluorouracil. If these preparations still need to be used, great caution and a maximum of 25% of the normal starting dose of capecitabine or fluorouracil is recommended. Concentration determination is recommended as follow-up in fluorouracil treatment.
DPYD	0	<b>The genotyping has demonstrated an inability to break down fluoropyrimidines.</b><br> Avoid treatment with capecitabine and fluorouracil.
TPMT	2	<b>The genotyping indicates normal enzyme activity.</b><br> Treatment with mercaptopurine, azathioprine or thioguanine should therefore be based on the patient's other conditions.
TPMT	1	<b>The genotyping indicates partially reduced enzyme activity.</b><br> When treating with mercaptopurine, azathioprine or thioguanine, a halving of the starting dose should be considered. Alternatively, a reduced starting dose according to the current treatment protocol. Concentration determination of metabolites should be considered.
TPMT	0	<b>The genotyping indicates very low or no enzyme activity.</b><br> When treating with mercaptopurine, azathioprine or thioguanine, great caution and a maximum of 10% of the normal dose is recommended. Alternatively, a reduced starting dose according to the current treatment protocol. Concentration determination of metabolites is recommended. Alternative drug therapy should be considered.
NUDT15	2	<b>The genotyping indicates normal enzyme activity.</b><br> Treatment with mercaptopurine, azathioprine or thioguanine should therefore be based on the patient's other conditions.
NUDT15	1	<b>The genotyping indicates partially reduced enzyme activity.</b><br> When treating with mercaptopurine, azathioprine or thioguanine, a halving of the starting dose should be considered. Alternatively, a reduced starting dose according to the current treatment protocol. Concentration determination of metabolites should be considered.
NUDT15	0	<b>The genotyping indicates very low or no enzyme activity.</b><br> When treating with mercaptopurine, azathioprine or thioguanine, great caution and a maximum of 10% of the normal dose is recommended. Alternatively, a reduced starting dose according to the current treatment protocol. Concentration determination of metabolites is recommended. Alternative drug therapy should be considered.
