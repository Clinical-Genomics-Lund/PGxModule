NUDT15	TPMT	2	2	<b>The genotyping indicates normal enzyme activity.<\b><br><b>There are no genetic findings that speak against an ordinary starting dose.<\b> <br>When treated with mercaptopurine, azathioprine or thioguanine, the starting dose should be based on the current treatment protocol . Usual follow-up is recommended.
NUDT15	TPMT	1	2	<b>The genotyping indicates partially reduced NUDT15 enzyme activity.<\b><b><br>When treating with mercaptopurine, azathioprine or thioguanine, a halving of the starting dose should be considered.<\b> <br>Alternatively, the starting dose is given according to the current treatment protocol.
